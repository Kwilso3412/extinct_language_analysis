# Extinct Language Analysis
This project was created for a course in my Data Science Masters program. 

You can view the full dashboard [here](https://kahlyll-wilson.shinyapps.io/extinct_languages/)

The [extinct languages dataset](https://data.world/ian/extinct-languages) can be found on [data.world](https://data.world/) from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/15/language-extinct-endangered#data). The story is based on an indigenous language going extinct because the two remaining speakers refuse to speak to each other. The dataset is a full list of all the endangered or extinct languages around the world.
